## Brownie Batter Base Ingredients
- **8 Tbsp** (1 stick) unsalted butter (110g), melted
- **1 cup** granulated sugar (200g)
- **1/2 cup** unsweetened cocoa powder (50g)
- **2 large eggs**
- **1 tsp** vanilla extract (4g)
- **1/2 cup** all-purpose flour (75g)
- **1/2 tsp** kosher salt (2g)
- **1/4 tsp** baking powder (1g)

## Peanut Butter Swirl Ingredients
- **2 Tbsp** unsalted butter, melted (30g)
- **1/4 cup** powdered sugar (30g)
- **1/3 cup** smooth peanut butter (90g)
- **1/4 tsp** kosher salt (1g)

## Directions
- Heat the oven to 325Â°F and grease an 8 inch-square baking dish. Line the pan with parchment paper so there is a 2 inch overhang on opposite sides. These will serve as handles to lift the brownies from the pan.
- Whisk together the melted butter, sugar, and cocoa powder in a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs and vanilla and vigorously whisk to combine.
- Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in a separate bowl, then stir it into the chocolate mixture until just combined. Set aside.
- Add the butter, powdered sugar, peanut butter, and salt to a small bowl and mix until smooth.
- Use the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to spread half of the brownie batter evenly into the baking dish. (The batter will be very thick).
- Spoon half of the peanut butter swirl in tablespoon-sized dollops on top of the brownie batter.
- Top with the remaining brownie batter and spread evenly, then dollop the rest of the peanut butter filling on top.
- Insert a skewer or butter knife all the way to the bottom of the pan and drag the edge through the peanut butter dollops to make swirls.
- Bake for 30-35 minutes, until puffed and lightly browned on top. Do not overbake.
- A toothpick inserted into the center should come out a little wet with lots of crumbs.
- Cool completely, then use the parchment handles to lift them from the pan and transfer to a cutting board.
- Cut into squares and serve.
