## Ingredients, Seasoning
- **2 1/2 Tbsp** paprika
- **2 Tbsp** salt
- **2 Tbsp** garlic powder
- **1 Tbsp** black pepper
- **1 Tbsp** onion powder
- **1 Tbsp** cayenne pepper
- **1 Tbsp** dried leaf oregano
- **1 Tbsp** dried thyme

## Ingredients
- 1/2 pound lean ground beef
- **1/2 tsp** salt
- **1/4 tsp** freshly ground black pepper
- **1/4 tsp** Essence
- **1 Tbsp** olive or vegetable oil
- **1/3 cup** chopped yellow onions

## Directions
- Season the beef with the salt, pepper, and Essence.
- In a large cast iron skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the seasoned beef and cook, stirring, until well browned and all pink has disappeared. Drain off any excess oil from the skillet and discard.
- Add the onions and cook, stirring, until soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and garlic and cook, stirring until the mushrooms have released their juices, about 2 minutes. Add the beef broth and cook, stirring, until the mixture reduces slightly, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the cooked macaroni and warm for 2 minutes, then stir in the sour cream.
- Remove the pan from the heat and spoon the mixture onto 2 large plates. Sprinkle each portion with the cheese, if desired, and chopped parsley and serve immediately.
