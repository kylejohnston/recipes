## Ingredients
<!-- Tablespoons = Tbsp | Teaspons = tsp | Cup = cup | lb/oz/g = lowercase -->
- Olive oil 
- **600g (2 10oz bags)** frozen precut mirepoix mix (carrot, onion, celery) 
- **3g** or **1tsp** garlic powder 
- **2g** or **1tsp** black pepper 
- **1-2g** or **1tsp** dried oregano 
- **75g** or **(1/4c)** chicken better than bouillon 
- **2 900g/32oz boxes** chicken stock (1800g/64oz total) 
- **150g** or **1 1/3c orzo** (sub broken ramen noodles or frozen rice for a gluten free option) 
- **150g** or **3-4** large swiss chard leaves, chopped (or other leafy green of choice) 
- **450g/1lb** rotisserie chicken meat (or baked chicken thighs), chopped 
- **2-3g** or **1tsp** turmeric 
- **150g** or **1 1/4c** frozen peas 


## Directions
- Add a generous squeeze of olive oil into a large preheated heavy bottomed pot over high heat followed by mirepoix. 
- Stir and cook for 1-2 mins until thawed and starting to soften. 
- Add garlic powder, pepper, and oregano (feel free to eyeball it). Stir and fry for about a minute until fragrant. 
- Stir in chicken bouillon paste then chicken stock. 
- Add orzo (if subbing orzo with frozen rice wait to add until later). Bring soup to a simmer. 
- About 4-5 minutes from when orzo/pasta is done cooking, stir chard/greens. Reduce heat to medium/med-low and cook until greens are tender and orzo is cooked to al dente. 
- Stir in turmeric, frozen peas, and chopped chicken just to heat through. If using frozen or pre-cooked rice, add it during this step. 
- Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt if needed. I usually add a large pinch of salt or 2 at this step. Be sure to stir salt in well to dissolve before adding more. 
- Garnish with black pepper, a drizzle of olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, and fresh dill if you have it. 
- Makes 4â€“6 portions
