## Ingredients
<!-- Tablespoons = Tbsp | Teaspons = tsp | Cup = cup | lb/oz/g = lowercase -->
- Diced onion
- Garlic
- **1 cup** grated cheddar
- **2 cups** egg noodles 
- **1/3 cup** sour cream
- **2 Tbsp** salted butter
- **1 Tbsp** ketchup
- **A few dashes** Worcestershire sauce 
- **1-1/2 cups** beef broth 
- Ground beef, cheesesteak-style 

## Directions
- Prep beef similar to cheesesteak / Dream sandwiches
- Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ground beef and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook the meat, crumbling as you go, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
- Add the noodles and broth. Give a big stir and bring to a simmer. Cover and allow everything to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce has thickened, about 12 minutes. Stir in the sour cream and cook for 1 additional minute or until the pasta is tender.
- Serve
