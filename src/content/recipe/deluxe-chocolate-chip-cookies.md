## Ingredients
<!-- Tablespoons = Tbsp | Teaspons = tsp | Cup = cup | lb/oz/g = lowercase -->
- **2 Â½ sticks**, unsalted butter
- **1** ice cube
- **375 grams**, light brown sugar
- **125 grams**, white sugar
- **2** large eggs + **1** yolk
- **1 Tbsp** vanilla extract
- **1/2 tsp** almond extract
- **240 grams**, cake flour
- **240 grams**, bread flour
- **1 Â½ tsp** baking soda
- **1 Â½ tsp** kosher salt
- **300 grams**, milk chocolate feves or bars, roughly chopped
- **300 grams**, dark chocolate feves or bars, roughly chopped
- Flaky sea salt

## Directions
- Brown the butter over medium heat.
- Pour the browned butter into the bowl of a stand mixer, add the ice cube and let melt to cool down the butter.
- Add both sugars. Using a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment mix the butter and sugar until well incorporated, about 3 minutes.
- Add the eggs and yolk, 1 at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds until combined.
- Add vanilla extract, almond extract and beat to combine.
- Switch to paddle attachment. Sift together both flours, baking soda and salt. Add to wet ingredients, beating on low speed until just combined.
- Fold in both chocolates.
- Cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, ideally 72 hours. Do not skip this step!
- When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Form the cold dough into 90 gram balls. Flatten into a puck shape roughly 2.5 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. Top with flaky sea salt.
- Bake until golden brown but still fudgy inside, about 14-16 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.
- Remove from baking sheet and cool on a wire rack to prevent too much browning on the bottom.

## Tips
- My favorite chocolate to use is a mix of Valrhona Manjari and Jivara feves.
- The dough gets significantly better after 3 days in the refrigerator. The batter can be formed into pucks and baked from the freezer with 30-60 minutes of thawing at room temperature.
- Parchment is better than silicone for thicker cookies, because silicone causes the dough to spread too fast.
- If you like a thinner crispier cookie: 1. do not add the extra yolk, 2. bring dough to room temperature before baking, 3. halfway through baking drop the pan onto the countertop from a height of a few inches to deflate the cookies and create ripples (also known as the pan-banging technique).
