## Ingredients
<!-- Tablespoons = Tbsp | Teaspons = tsp | Cup = cup | lb/oz/g = lowercase -->
- 1 lb ground breakfast sausage
- 1 medium onion , diced
- 1 small red bell pepper , diced
- 2 cloves garlic  , minced
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1/2 tsp dry ground mustard (optional)
- 1 1/2 cups shredded Colby jack cheese , divided

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9Ã—13 casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
- In a medium nonstick skillet, combine the sausage, onions, and bell pepper over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up the sausage into crumbles with a wooden spoon, until browned and no pink remains.
- Add in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Drain the grease from the sausage mixture and spread it in the casserole dish.

- Sprinkle half of the cheese and all of the tater tots into the casserole dish.
- Bake the casserole for 55 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on the top of the casserole and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until eggs are cooked through.
- Let stand 5 minute before serving and enjoy!
