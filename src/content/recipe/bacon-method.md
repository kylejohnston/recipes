## Ingredients
<!-- Tablespoons = Tbsp | Teaspons = tsp | Cup = cup | lb/oz/g = lowercase -->
- Bacon

## Directions
- Line a pan with the bacon. You can use a glass baking pan, a steel or aluminum baking sheet, or even a cast iron pan.
- Put the pan into a cold, unheated oven. I use the middle rack.
- Set the oven to bake at 400°F (204°C).
- Set the timer for 20 minutes. It may take a bit more or less time, depending on your oven. You can calibrate your oven for even better results.
- Remove the pan from the oven. Place the bacon on a plate (or a plate lined with a paper towel if you’re grease averse).
- Enjoy the best, crispiest, most delicious bacon you’ve ever had.
